# Chinese Chess
*Project Abstract
Online Chinese Chess is a board game for 2 players using two computers with the same local network. This game simulates a war between two nations, with the goal of capturing the opponent's General. The purpose of the game is to create a virtual chess board so that players can start anytime, anywhere. There is only one mode and there is no possibility to save the currently playing board. This Online Chess game focuses on the development of an online chess game with a client/server. The game aims to solve problems where the player prefers to play in real-time against another player than against the computer.*
